Revision history for IO-Socket-IP

0.07_006 CHANGES:
         * Fallback AI_ADDRCONFIG to 0 on OSes that don't implement it

0.07_005 CHANGES:
         * Depend on Socket 1.95 now a full dual-life release has been made
         * Set the AI_ADDRCONFIG getaddrinfo hint
         * Added V6Only constructor argument to set IPV6_V6ONLY socket option

0.07_004 CHANGES:
         * Localise $1/$2 to placate [perl #67962]
         * Fix some spelling mistakes/typoes
         * Require Socket 1.94_03, rather than dynamic
           Socket-or-Socket::GetAddrInfo, now that Socket is dual-life.
         * Simpler Build.PL now it has no dynamic dependencies

0.07_003 CHANGES:
         * Bugfix for (e.g.) NetBSD, which gets upset at protocol hint without
           socktype hint to getaddrinfo()
         * Added configure_requires Module::Build

0.07_002 CHANGES:
         * MSWin32 uses select() exceptfds rather than writefds to report on
           nonblocking connect() failure
         * Pass 'type' rather than 'proto' to constructor in t/11sockopts.t to
           avoid MSWin32 test failures
         * Ensure ->socket protocol argument is always defined

0.07_001 CHANGES:
         * MSWin32 uses EWOULDBLOCK rather than EINPROGRESS to indicate
           nonblocking connect()

0.07    CHANGES:
         * Prepare for Socket::getaddrinfo() in core; prefer it to
           Socket::GetAddrInfo::getaddrinfo()
         * Implement Family constructor arg
         * Optional registration with IO::Socket
         * Documentation rewordings
         * Bugfix to local socket connect tests - test using blocking rather
           than nonblocking sockets to guarantee synchronous packet delivery
         * Bugfix to t/04, t/05 - skip if unable to bind ::1

0.06    CHANGES:
         * Implement nonblocking connect
         * Implement LocalAddrInfo and PeerAddrInfo args
         * Example of nonblocking usage, using Net::LibAsyncNS

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Implement combined ->bind and ->connect operations
         * Accept "host:service" as *Addr args, and PeerAddr as sole
           constructor argument
         * Accept "name(port)" as service arguments

0.04    CHANGES:
         * Try to yield the most appropriate connect/bind/socket error
         * Implement sockhost/peerhost methods to match ::INET, moved hostname
           methods to sockhostname/peerhostname
        
        BUGFIXES:
         * Work around IO::Socket bug where ->accept'ed sockets do not get
           ->sockdomain or ->socktype

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Set $@ to raise error messages from constructor

        BUGFIXES:
         * Correctly implement 'Type' constructor argument
         * Test SO_BROADCAST on udp instead of tcp as some OSes forbid it

0.02    BUGFIXES:
         * Not all OSes return true sockopts as 1; test simply for non-zero
         * Gracefully skip IPv6 tests if Socket6 unavailable

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
