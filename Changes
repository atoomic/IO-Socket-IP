Revision history for IO-Socket-IP

0.07    CHANGES:
         * Prepare for Socket::getaddrinfo() in core; prefer it to
           Socket::GetAddrInfo::getaddrinfo()
         * Implement Family constructor arg
         * Optional registration with IO::Socket
         * Documentation rewordings
         * Bugfix to local socket connect tests - test using blocking rather
           than nonblocking sockets to guarantee synchronous packet delivery
         * Bugfix to t/04, t/05 - skip if unable to bind ::1

0.06    CHANGES:
         * Implement nonblocking connect
         * Implement LocalAddrInfo and PeerAddrInfo args
         * Example of nonblocking usage, using Net::LibAsyncNS

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Implement combined ->bind and ->connect operations
         * Accept "host:service" as *Addr args, and PeerAddr as sole
           constructor argument
         * Accept "name(port)" as service arguments

0.04    CHANGES:
         * Try to yield the most appropriate connect/bind/socket error
         * Implement sockhost/peerhost methods to match ::INET, moved hostname
           methods to sockhostname/peerhostname
        
        BUGFIXES:
         * Work around IO::Socket bug where ->accept'ed sockets do not get
           ->sockdomain or ->socktype

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Set $@ to raise error messages from constructor

        BUGFIXES:
         * Correctly implement 'Type' constructor argument
         * Test SO_BROADCAST on udp instead of tcp as some OSes forbid it

0.02    BUGFIXES:
         * Not all OSes return true sockopts as 1; test simply for non-zero
         * Gracefully skip IPv6 tests if Socket6 unavailable

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
